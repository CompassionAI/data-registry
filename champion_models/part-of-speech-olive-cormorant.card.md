# Card: part-of-speech-olive-cormorant

The details of the training protocol are in the training results card.

## Purpose

Part-of-speech tagging via a fine-tuned monolingual transformer. Uses the concatenated intrasyllabic SOAS tags described in the processed dataset part-of-speech-intersyllabic-olive. The SOAS tags are tokenized without tsheg pre-tokenization.

## Model description

Fine-tuned AlBERT-olive-cormorant transformer.

## Training data

Directly ingests the training data from part-of-speech-olive. The only change is a random 90-10 test set split.

## Training protocol

See the training results card for this model.

## Notable limitations (optional)

Due to resource constraints, currently this is a base-sized model of width 128.
