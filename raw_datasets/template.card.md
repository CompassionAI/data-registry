# Template raw dataset card

Use the headline "Card: _dataset-name_".

Use this as a template to make cards for raw datasets. The file name is "_dataset-name_.card.md".

**NB**: Currently CompassionAI does not create its own raw datasets, thus this is an abbreviated card. If this ever changes, the dataset cards made by CompassionAI should conform to the [Huggingface standard](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/templates/README_guide.md).
