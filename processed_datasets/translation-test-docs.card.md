# Card: translation-test-docs

## Purpose

Sample documents for manual review of translation outputs.

## Warnings

Some of the documents are only extracts from their corresponding larger texts.

## Root datasets

## Methodology

These are hand-picked extracts from major Tibetan Buddhist texts. They include both sutra and tantra, and examples that are both near and far from the training data. The Manjushri-nama-samgiti is included as a stress test.

## How to reproduce

These were hand-picked extracts. There is no reproducible methodology as it is curated by hand.
